- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CDcruzCode.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a lot of different creative hobbies including music production, 3D art, vector art, and of course, coding.<br>
  I'm not the most experienced coder, but I am mighty fine at googling what I need. I usually use AWS to host my websites, but I'm interested in seeing how Github could help my workflow.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# to use in the Godot Engine. I also enjoy creating web apps or cool static websites like www.NightCityShards.net
- ðŸ“« If you need to reach me or just have a chat you can find all my social links at www.cdcruz.com
